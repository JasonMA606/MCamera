 * This demo tries to use android.hardware.Camera API to create a customView camera application.
 * Although android.hardware.Camera API is deprecated since API 21 (Android 5.0) and replaced by android.hardware.Camera2,
 * we could still use Camera which is more simple for a tyro.
 * <p>
 * In this case, we need to achieve five goals:
 * ** Using surfaceView to preview Camera.
 * ** Using cardView to make the preview looks better.
 * ** Changing camera preview ratio to 4:3 (more suitable for cardView Camera, not for whole screen camera)
 * ** Setting picture size.
 * ** Saving the picture on our Android device.
